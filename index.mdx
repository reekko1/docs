### Key Platform Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lenses - Clinical Data Categories" icon="eye">
    **Lenses** are how we organize patient clinical data:
    - **Vitals** - Heart rate, blood pressure, temperature
    - **Labs** - Laboratory results with values and units  
    - **Medications** - Current and past medications
    - **Problems** - Medical conditions and diagnoses
    - **Plans** - Treatment protocols and next steps
    - And more...
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Logs - Clinical Updates" icon="clipboard">
    **Logs** are clinical updates that providers post throughout the day:
    - Status updates and observations
    - Team communication and alignment
    - Patient progress tracking
    - Chronological clinical record
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review-First AI" icon="shield-check">
    Our AI generates **draft content** that providers always review:
    - Voice and image transcription create starting points
    - Providers edit and approve before posting
    - Human oversight ensures clinical accuracy
    - No automatic posting without review
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
