<Info>
**For newcomers:** NarraChat is your intelligent medical conversation partner that automatically routes your questions to the right specialist. Ask about medical calculations, research literature, or patient information, and it intelligently decides which expert AI agent should handle your request while streaming real-time responses.

**For senior devs:** Agno team-based conversational AI system using "route" mode for intelligent delegation to 3 specialized medical agents. PostgreSQL session persistence, native streaming with intermediate events, workspace-scoped multi-tenancy, and comprehensive medical compliance features. 70% code reduction vs legacy chat systems.
</Info>

## Overview

NarraChat represents the next generation of conversational AI for healthcare professionals, providing intelligent routing to specialized medical agents with real-time streaming responses. Unlike traditional chatbots, NarraChat understands medical context and automatically delegates requests to the most appropriate specialist agent.

## Intelligent Routing System

NarraChat's team leader analyzes incoming messages and intelligently routes them to the appropriate specialist:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Message Analysis">
    The team leader analyzes the user's message to understand intent and context
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Route Decision">
    Based on keywords, medical context, and intent, determines the best agent:
    - **Medical calculations** → Medical Calculator Agent
    - **Research questions** → Literature Search Agent
    - **Patient information** → Patient Query Agent
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Agent Execution">
    The selected agent processes the request using its specialized tools and knowledge
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Response Generation">
    Results are formatted with appropriate medical context and compliance features
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Routing Examples

## Medical Compliance & Safety

### Clinical Standards

<Warning>
**Medical Disclaimer**: NarraChat is designed for healthcare professional use only. All responses include appropriate medical disclaimers and should not replace clinical judgment.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Citation Requirements" icon="quote-left">
    Patient data queries include mandatory [1], [2], [3] style citations for clinical compliance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace Isolation" icon="shield">
    Complete multi-tenant data isolation ensures patient privacy and HIPAA compliance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evidence Quality" icon="award">
    Literature searches include evidence quality assessment (Level I-V) per WHO standards
  </Card>
  <Card title="Professional Context" icon="user-doctor">
    All responses formatted for healthcare professional communication standards
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Safety Features

- **Workspace-scoped access**: All patient data strictly isolated by workspace
- **Audit trails**: Complete logging of all interactions for compliance
- **Medical disclaimers**: Automatic inclusion in all clinical responses
- **Evidence verification**: Citations with direct links to source material
- **Professional language**: Medical terminology and appropriate clinical context

## Team Management

### Create Team Instance

```http
POST /api/v1/chat_v3/teams
```

<ParamField body="workspace_id" type="string" required>
  Workspace identifier for the team instance
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="user_id" type="string" optional>
  User identifier for team customization
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="debug_mode" type="boolean" optional>
  Enable detailed logging (default: false)
</ParamField>

### Health Check

```http
GET /api/v1/chat_v3/health
```

Returns system health status including:
- Team configuration status
- Agent availability
- Database connectivity
- External service status (Perplexity, Calculator API)

## Performance Considerations

### Response Times by Agent

| Agent Type | Typical Response Time | Factors |
|------------|----------------------|---------|
| Medical Calculator | 1-3 seconds | Calculator complexity, API latency |
| Literature Search | 3-8 seconds | Query complexity, research depth |
| Patient Query | 2-5 seconds | Data volume, query specificity |

### Optimization Features

- **Intelligent caching**: Frequently accessed patient data and calculations
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple tool calls within agents when possible
- **Stream buffering**: Optimized for real-time user experience
- **Session persistence**: PostgreSQL storage for conversation continuity

### Rate Limits

- **Requests per minute**: 60 per API key
- **Concurrent conversations**: 5 per workspace
- **Message length**: 4,000 characters maximum
- **Session duration**: 2 hours active, 24 hours total

## System Architecture

### NarraChat vs NarraLenses

| Aspect | NarraChat | NarraLenses |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Interactive conversational AI | Clinical data processing |
| **Interaction Model** | Real-time conversations | Batch log processing |
| **Agent Count** | 3 specialized agents | 8 clinical lens agents |
| **Use Cases** | Research, calculations, patient queries | Structured clinical data extraction |
| **Framework Mode** | Agno "route" mode | Agno "coordinate" mode |
| **Response Format** | Conversational with citations | Structured clinical analysis |

### Integration Points

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Shared Infrastructure">
    **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase for session storage
    **Authentication**: Same API key system as main application
    **Logging**: Integrated with main application logging framework
    **Configuration**: Shared settings and environment variables
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Service Dependencies">
    **Perplexity API**: Literature search capabilities
    **NarraLabs Calculator API**: Medical calculation engine
    **Firebase**: Patient data access (via Patient Query Agent)
    **OpenAI**: Team leader and reasoning capabilities
