## What is NarraFields?

NarraFields automatically extracts clinical information from your patient notes based on custom fields you define. You decide what data matters to your practice - blood pressure readings, medication changes, symptoms, or any clinical indicator - and AI finds it in your existing documentation.

### How It Works (3 Steps)

1. **📋 You Define Custom Fields** - Decide what clinical data to track
2. **🤖 AI Processes Your Notes** - Extracts the information you specified  
3. **✅ You Review and Use Data** - Approve suggestions and access organized information

Every practice is different. You define what's important to track.

## Step 1: Define Your Custom Fields

The first step is deciding what clinical information you want to extract and track.

### How You Create a Custom Field

**Step 1: Name Your Field**
> "Pain Scale Rating"

**Step 2: Describe What You Want**
> "Extract the patient's current pain level on a 1-10 scale when mentioned in clinical notes"

**Step 3: Give Examples**
> - "Pain 7/10 today" → Extract: "7"
> - "Reports pain level of 4 out of 10" → Extract: "4"  
> - "No pain currently" → Extract: "0"

**Step 4: Set Your Preferences**
- **Auto-approve routine values?** (like objective pain scores)
- **Require review for important changes?** (like severe pain increases)
- **Update automatically when new notes are added?**

### Field Types You Can Create

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 2: AI Processes Your Notes

Once you've defined your fields, AI automatically reads through your patient notes to extract the information.

### Teaching the AI Your Language

The system learns your documentation style:
- Your abbreviations (HTN, DM, etc.)
- Your terminology and format preferences
- Your clinical patterns

**Example:**
1. You create field: "Blood Pressure Reading" 
2. AI finds: "BP 140/90" in your notes
3. You confirm: "Yes, that's correct"
4. AI learns: Your practice uses "BP" for blood pressure
5. Next time: AI automatically recognizes "BP 130/85"

## Step 3: Review and Use Your Data

### Real Examples of How It Works

### Example 1: Blood Pressure Tracking

**Your Note:**
> "Patient reports feeling dizzy this morning. BP check shows 165/95, up from last visit. Discussed lifestyle modifications. Started lisinopril 10mg daily. Follow-up in 2 weeks to recheck."

**What NarraFields Does:**
1. 🤖 **AI Reads Your Note**: Scans the text for blood pressure information
2. 📊 **Extracts Key Data**: Identifies "165/95" as the current blood pressure
3. 📝 **Creates Structured Field**: Automatically fills "Current Blood Pressure: 165/95"
4. 🔗 **Links to Source**: Points back to your original note for context
5. ✅ **Ready for Use**: Now you can easily find all patients with elevated BP

**The Result:** Instead of searching through notes manually, you can now instantly find all patients with elevated blood pressure readings.

### Example 2: Medication Management

**Your Note:**
> "Patient doing well on current diabetes management. A1C improved to 7.2%. Increasing metformin from 500mg BID to 1000mg BID. Continue lifestyle counseling."

**What NarraFields Extracts:**
- **Current A1C**: 7.2%
- **Medication Change**: Metformin increased to 1000mg BID
- **Diabetes Status**: Well-controlled
- **Next Action**: Continue current plan

**The Benefit:** You can quickly find all patients on specific medications and track medication changes over time.

### Example 3: Preventive Care Tracking

**Your Note:**
> "Annual physical. Patient reports no new concerns. Due for mammogram - scheduled for next month. Flu shot given today. Discussed colorectal cancer screening - patient prefers FIT test."

**What Gets Organized:**
- **Mammogram**: Scheduled (due date tracked)
- **Flu Vaccine**: Completed today
- **Colorectal Screening**: FIT test preferred
- **Next Visit**: Annual follow-up

**The Impact:** You can easily track preventive care discussions and follow up with patients about pending screenings.

### The Approval Process

For critical clinical information, NarraFields uses a **human-in-the-loop** approach:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[📋 You Define Custom Field] --> B[📝 You Write Notes] 
    B --> C[🤖 AI Reads & Extracts]
    C --> D{🩺 Needs Review?}
    D -->|Critical Info| E[⏸️ Waits for Your Approval]
    D -->|Routine Data| F[✅ Auto-Approved]
    E --> G[👩‍⚕️ You Review & Approve]
    E --> H[❌ You Reject & Correct]
    G --> I[📊 Available for Use]
    H --> J[📝 Manual Entry Option]
    F --> I
```

### What Gets Auto-Approved vs. Human Review

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Usually Auto-Approved">
    **Objective measurements that are clearly documented:**
    - Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, weight)
    - Lab values with clear results
    - Medication dosages when explicitly stated
    - Appointment dates and scheduling
    
    **Example**: "BP 120/80" → Auto-approved as objective measurement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="👩‍⚕️ Usually Requires Review">
    **Clinical judgments and interpretations:**
    - Diagnosis changes or new diagnoses
    - Treatment plan modifications
    - Risk assessments
    - Clinical decision-making
    
    **Example**: "Appears to have early signs of heart failure" → Requires physician review
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Complete Audit Trail

NarraFields maintains a complete audit trail of every action:

**What Gets Tracked:**
- When AI extracts values from notes
- When you approve or reject AI suggestions  
- When you manually update field values
- Who made each change and exactly when

**Why This Matters:**
- **Clinical Safety:** Verify sources, track approvals, maintain accountability
- **Compliance:** Meet documentation requirements, support regulatory reviews
- **Team Coordination:** See who updated what and when

**Example:** A patient's blood pressure field shows "150/95" and you can trace it back to: "Extracted from note dated Jan 10, 2024: 'BP check shows 150/95, patient reports headache' - Dr. Johnson approved this value on Jan 10, 2024 at 3:45 PM"

## Day-in-the-Life Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Huddle

**Before NarraFields:**
> "Can someone check which of our diabetes patients mentioned blood sugar issues in their last visits? And do we know who has blood pressure readings over 140 lately?"

*Someone spends 30 minutes reviewing charts manually.*

**With NarraFields:**
> "Let me check our custom fields... I can see 12 patients with recent blood sugar concerns, and we have 8 patients with BP readings over 140 documented in their last visits."

*Information available instantly from extracted data.*

### Scenario 2: Clinical Data Retrieval

**Before NarraFields:**
> "We need to find all diabetic patients with A1C values over 8.0 for follow-up calls. Sarah, can you review 200 charts and extract the latest A1C for each?"

*Hours of manual chart review.*

**With NarraFields:**
> "I can instantly pull up all patients with A1C over 8.0 from our custom field. Here are 23 patients who need follow-up calls."

*Instant clinical data retrieval.*

### Scenario 3: Patient Safety

**Before NarraFields:**
> "Did anyone notice if Mrs. Johnson mentioned drug allergies during her last few visits? Let me check her notes..."

*Digging through multiple visit notes.*

**With NarraFields:**
> "Mrs. Johnson's allergy field shows 'Penicillin (rash)' extracted from her March visit note, and it was flagged for verification."

*Safety information prominently displayed.*
