<Info>
**For Clinical Teams**: Learn how NarraFields extracts custom data from your patient notes - you define what matters to your practice.

**For Practice Managers**: See how custom fields organize clinical information without changing your workflow.
</Info>

## What is NarraFields?

<Info>
**The Problem:**
Important clinical data gets buried in notes, making it hard to track trends or find specific information quickly.
</Info>

NarraFields automatically extracts clinical information from your patient notes based on custom fields you define. 

**You decide what matters:**
- Blood pressure readings
- Medication changes  
- Symptom patterns
- Any clinical indicator important to your practice

**AI finds it in your existing documentation** - no workflow changes required.

### How It Works

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. Define What Matters" icon="clipboard-list">
    "Track pain scores 1-10"
    
    You decide what to extract
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. AI Finds It" icon="robot">
    "Pain 7/10 today" → 7
    
    Automatic extraction from notes
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Use Organized Data" icon="chart-line">
    Instant lists, trends, alerts
    
    Clinical information at your fingertips
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Every practice is different. You define what's important to track.

## Step 1: Define Your Custom Fields

<Info>
The first step is deciding what clinical information you want to extract and track.
</Info>

### How You Create a Custom Field

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Field Creation Process">
    **Step 1: Name Your Field**
    > "Pain Scale Rating"

    **Step 2: Describe What You Want**
    > "Extract the patient's current pain level on a 1-10 scale when mentioned in clinical notes"

    **Step 3: Give Examples**
    > - "Pain 7/10 today" → Extract: "7"
    > - "Reports pain level of 4 out of 10" → Extract: "4"  
    > - "No pain currently" → Extract: "0"

    **Step 4: Set Your Preferences**
    - **Auto-approve routine values?** (like objective pain scores)
    - **Require review for important changes?** (like severe pain increases)
    - **Update automatically when new notes are added?**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 2: AI Processes Your Notes

<Info>
Configure how AI processes your fields with precise control over automation, approval requirements, and fallback behavior.
</Info>

### How You Control AI Processing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Processing Triggers">
    **Manual Processing**: You choose when to process and which patients
    
    **Auto-Update**: Automatically processes when new notes are added
    
    **Overwrite Protection**: Preserves manual entries unless you choose otherwise
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Approval Settings">
    **Auto-Approve**: Objective data (vital signs, lab values) saves immediately
    
    **Require Review**: Clinical judgments wait for your approval before saving
    
    **Custom Fallbacks**: Define what AI should do when information isn't clear
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Example Setup:**
Field: "Primary Diagnosis" → Auto-update enabled → Requires approval → Fallback: "Pending evaluation"

## Step 3: Review and Use Your Data

<Info>

</Info>

### Real Examples of How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Blood Pressure Tracking">
    **Your Note:**
    > "Patient reports feeling dizzy this morning. BP check shows 165/95, up from last visit. Discussed lifestyle modifications. Started lisinopril 10mg daily."

    **What NarraFields Extracts:**
    - Blood Pressure: 165/95
    - Symptom: Dizziness
    - New Medication: Lisinopril 10mg daily

    **The Result:** Instantly find all patients with elevated BP readings without searching through notes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Medication Management">
    **Your Note:**
    > "Patient doing well on current diabetes management. A1C improved to 7.2%. Increasing metformin from 500mg BID to 1000mg BID."

    **What NarraFields Extracts:**
    - Current A1C: 7.2%
    - Medication Change: Metformin increased to 1000mg BID
    - Diabetes Status: Well-controlled

    **The Result:** Quickly find all patients on specific medications and track changes over time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preventive Care Tracking">
    **Your Note:**
    > "Due for mammogram - scheduled for next month. Flu shot given today. Discussed colorectal cancer screening - patient prefers FIT test."

    **What NarraFields Extracts:**
    - Mammogram: Scheduled (due date tracked)
    - Flu Vaccine: Completed today
    - Colorectal Screening: FIT test preferred

    **The Result:** Easily track preventive care discussions and follow up with patients about pending screenings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### The Approval Process

For critical clinical information, NarraFields uses a **human-in-the-loop** approach where you maintain control over what gets automatically processed versus what requires your review.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[You Define Custom Field] --> B[You Write Notes] 
    B --> C[AI Reads & Extracts]
    C --> D{Needs Review?}
    D -->|Critical Info| E[Waits for Your Approval]
    D -->|Routine Data| F[Auto-Approved]
    E --> G[You Review & Approve]
    E --> H[You Reject & Correct]
    G --> I[Available for Use]
    H --> J[Manual Entry Option]
    F --> I
```

### What Gets Auto-Approved vs. Human Review

<Note>
Critical clinical information always waits for your approval. You decide what requires review when setting up each field.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Usually Auto-Approved">
    **Objective measurements that are clearly documented:**
    - Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, weight)
    - Lab values with clear results
    - Medication dosages when explicitly stated
    - Appointment dates and scheduling
    
    **Example**: "BP 120/80" → Auto-approved as objective measurement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Usually Requires Review">
    **Clinical judgments and interpretations:**
    - Diagnosis changes or new diagnoses
    - Treatment plan modifications
    - Risk assessments
    - Clinical decision-making
    
    **Example**: "Appears to have early signs of heart failure" → Requires physician review
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
